The Book of Noah.

Me and my Mate decided that one night we go on a Hunting Expedition.

Barry and I, decided it was time to hit the Forest. It was a cold night and not so many hunters would be out for a good piece of meet tonight. 
The night was one of those nights that you wouldn't miss out when sharing boring stories with your relatives that you have less in common with at the homecoming. We knew it was a jungle out there. 
It wasn't the only craziest idea we've ever had or something we've ever done, it was perfect.

On our strange journey, we scoped somewhat possible and promising preys. It was slowly beginning to be a more favorable night for us.

Excited!

We had a plan, at least that's what we thought until we bumped into Patrick Sturdon , Barry's old buddy.
 They haven't seen each other since 2012 when he once visited his parents. 
A really nice guy. I started to think.
